# Info

Just for testing deploying streamlit and comparing streamlit and django for creating the user interface of my planned irrigation system.

The file `config_data` contains the adjustable sizes of the irrigation system.
The Raspberry of the irrigation system will save data in `shadow.json`.

# Have a look
Start the app with `streamlit run test.py` from the corresponding directory
or just open the link
